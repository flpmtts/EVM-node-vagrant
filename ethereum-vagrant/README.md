# EVM Node Vagrant Setup

This project provides a development environment configured with **Vagrant** to easily and efficiently run an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) node. It is designed to simplify the installation and setup process of an Ethereum node, allowing developers to interact with the blockchain locally.

## Key Features:
- **Automated Setup**: Vagrant automatically provisions the development environment, setting up all the necessary dependencies to run an Ethereum node.
- **Geth Support**: Includes support for Geth (Go-Ethereum), one of the most popular Ethereum implementations.
- **Easy Customization**: Configuration files can be adjusted to suit your specific needs.
- **Environment Isolation**: Vagrant provides a virtualized environment to ensure the Ethereum node installation does not interfere with your main operating system.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on any operating system that supports Vagrant (Linux, macOS, Windows).

## Requirements:
- **Vagrant** installed on your system.
- **VirtualBox** or another virtual machine provider supported by Vagrant.
